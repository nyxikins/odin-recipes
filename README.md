This is the 'HTML Foundations' Project: Recipes
Upon completion, I will have demonstrated various HTML skills including creating boilerplates, a main page, various other web pages, adding links and images, and making things bold and italicized. It will also increase my familiarity with using the terminal, VSCode, and GitHub.
